After you've finished the path sum question, try doing these tweaks if
you haven't already, and see how your new solutions impact the runtime
and space complexity:

1. use DFS in your solution
2. use BFS in your soultion
3. instead of looking for a "root-to-leaf path", allow yourself to use "any path starting from the root" to find the path sum
4. now allow "any path travelling down the tree"
5. now allow "any path in the tree, cross branches allowed"
6. try solving the original question on an `n`-ary tree (aka branching factor could be anything)
