## Goal ##
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that
returns the node at the beginning of the loop.

## Problem Definitions ##
Circular linked list: A linked list in which a node's next
pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in
the linked list.

## Example ##
Input:    A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]  
Output:   C
