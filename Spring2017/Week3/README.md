## Lesson

Trees (and some Graphs)

### Binary Search Trees

Each node has up to two children.

* how to implement one: 
* how to balance one:  
* runtime of insert/delete/search:  

### Traversals

* Inorder: recursive, iterative
* Preorder: recursive, iterative
* Postorder: recursive, iterative

### Search

* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Depth First Search (DFS)

## Interview Questions
