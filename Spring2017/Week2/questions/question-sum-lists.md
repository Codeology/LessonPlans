[<- Back to Week 2](..)

## Goal ##

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each
node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in _reverse_
order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write
a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a
linked list.

## Example ##

Input: [7]->[1]->[6] + [5]->[9]->[2] a.k.a. 617 + 295  
Output: [2]->[1]->[9] a.k.a. 912

## Follow up ##

Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above
problem.

## Example ##

Input: [6]->[1]->[7] + [2]->[9]->[5] a.k.a. 617 + 295  
Output: [9]->[1]->[2] a.k.a. 912
