## Lesson

Trees (and some Graphs)

### Binary Search Trees

Each node has up to two children.

* how to implement one: 
* how to balance one:  
* runtime of insert/delete/search:  

### Traversals

* Inorder: recursive, iterative
* Preorder: recursive, iterative
* Postorder: recursive, iterative

### Search

* [Breadth First Search (BFS)](./dfsbfs.py)
* [Depth First Search (DFS)](./dfsbfs.py)
